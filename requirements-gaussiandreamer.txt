# GaussianDreamer image-to-3D Gaussian generation dependencies (Phase 2)
# This file is used independently in setup-generation.sh
# Note: PyTorch installed first in setup script (required for tiny-cuda-nn build)
# Note: threestudio installed separately with --no-deps for isolation
# Note: numpy/Pillow re-enforced in setup script to resolve conflicts

# Core dependencies
